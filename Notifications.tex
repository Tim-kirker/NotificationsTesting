\section{Functional Testing Report}
\subsection{The functionality which is correctly implemented}


\subsection{Short-comings of the implemented functionality (with reference to pre- and post-conditions)}
\input{./1b}

\subsection{Any missing functionality}
\subsubsection{Alpha}
There is no missing functionality as the Alpha team attempted to implement all the specified functionality.


\section{Architecture compliance analysis}
\subsection{Which aspects of the software architecture specification were adhered to}
\subsubsection{Bravo}
The Bravo team has adhered to the following software architecture specifications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item They used Java code to create and send notifications using SMTP commands. Although there are no Java-EE annotations in the code, this code will still work in Java-EE.
	\item Their code is integrable as it is very easy to just call functions to request notifications sending.
	\item Their code is easily maintainable and there are very little dependancies for their code.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Which aspects of the software architecture specification were partially complied to, pointing out any short-comings with respect to the specification}
\input{./alpha_2b}

\subsection{Which aspects of the software architecture specification were not implemented}
\input{./2c}

\input{./2C}
